Welcome to the PHP Framework Wiki!

This wiki aim to help you (the developer) getting started with the framework quickly and to provide all the documentation needed to develop modules and web applications.<br/>
Feel free to contribute to this Wiki and the Framework!<br/>

**IMPORTANT**: Big changes are planned for this summer. In order to provide more features, as well as fixing some issues and making the framework more extensible, it will be entirely rewritten, from scratch.<br/>

The same working principles will be kept, but the way the framework works, as well as the provided functions, will change. Current projects using this framework may cease to work properly. <br/>
In order to prevent unexpected issues when attempting to update current projects to the new version, a new repository will most likely be created and this one, archived.<br/>

More details to come as I work out the exact details.
