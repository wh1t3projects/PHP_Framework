## Modules

#### What are modules?
Modules are extensions that can be installed in the Framework. They enable developers to add any kind of features that is needed for the web application they are building.<br/>
There is no real limit to what a module can do, except the imagination of developers. They can add features for helping with page rendering, others can provide helper functions to write less code. Some modules may even provide small web applications on their own, like Administration panels.<br/>
Please see below for official modules (which you can use as an example for your future module!).<br/>

#### How to install modules
The framework is built in way that installing a module is easy. Simply copy its folder in the **modules** folder!<br/>
If a module requires some configuration or additional installation steps, these will be provided in the *README* or *INSTALL* files.<br/>
