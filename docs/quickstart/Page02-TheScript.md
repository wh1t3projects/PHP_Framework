#### The script
It is now time to write your first script! If you already have some experience with PHP, this will be easy.<br/>
Create a file called **helloWorld.html** within the **webroot** folder and open it for editing. Next, copy the content of the **template.html** file into it (you can also just copy the file and rename it). <br/>
This template contains some HTML code that is made to work with the *default* theme, saving you some time. If you decided to not use the template and wrote some text inside, you will notice that it won't show up in your browser. That's because the text is hidden by the navigation bar. You would need to modify the theme's header to remove the bar in order to see your text.<br/>
